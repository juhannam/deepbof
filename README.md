Experiment code used in the paper, “A deep bag-of-features model for music auto-tagging” by Juhan Nam, Jorge Herrera and Kyogu Lee (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04999)

Refer to the following scripts to run the whole pipeline:

step1) process_tagatune_audio.m: preprocessing mp3 data

step2) run_tagatune_unsup.m: unsupervised learning from local feature learning to song-level pretraining for DNN  

step3) run_tagatune_dnn.m: supervised learning using DNN
